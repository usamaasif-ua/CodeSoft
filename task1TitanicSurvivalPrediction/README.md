I'm excited to share what I've accomplished in my Titanic Survival Prediction project! ðŸ’¼ Here's a brief rundown of the steps I've taken and the results I've obtained:

1. Importing Necessary Libraries
I started by importing essential libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn. These powerful tools provided the foundation for my analysis.

2. Data Preprocessing
I loaded the dataset using Pandas and performed an overview to understand its structure. I identified the number of rows and features, checked for missing values, and analyzed unique values in each feature.

3. Data Visualization
Visualizations played a key role in understanding the data. I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations such as box plots, distribution plots, and count plots to gain insights into the data's distribution and relationships.

4. Feature Engineering
In this step, I made necessary changes to the dataset to prepare it for modeling. I dropped certain columns like 'PassengerId', 'Name', 'Embarked', and 'Cabin'. I handled missing values by filling the 'Age' and 'Fare' columns with median values.

5. Encoding Categorical Data
I used Label Encoding to convert categorical data into numerical form. The 'Sex' column was transformed into numerical values using Label Encoder. Additionally, I extracted numeric values from the 'Ticket' column using regular expressions.

6. Model Building and Evaluation
This was the heart of the project! I trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models to predict passenger survival. Models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, and a Neural Network were tested.

7. Results
Among the models, both "Decision Tree" and "Random Forest" exhibited the highest accuracy of 1.00! This implies that these models were able to predict passenger survival with remarkable accuracy. I evaluated each model's performance using metrics like accuracy score and classification reports.

8. Conclusion
Through this project, I gained valuable insights into data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, and model evaluation. Achieving high accuracy in predicting Titanic passenger survival using machine learning models was both challenging and rewarding.
